## Authentication Debugging Results

### Current Status: 403 Forbidden (Permission Issue)

The authentication debugging has revealed that this is **NOT** an authentication problem, but a **permission/authorization problem**.

### Test Results Summary:

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `/` | GET | 200 | ✅ Success |
| `/health` | GET | 200 | ✅ Success |
| `/api/v1/track` | GET | 405 | ✅ Endpoint exists (Method Not Allowed) |
| `/api/v1/track` | POST | **403** | ❌ **Forbidden - Permission Denied** |

### Key Findings:

1. **Authentication Works**: The service account can successfully authenticate to the Cloud Run service (root endpoints return 200).

2. **Path-Specific Permissions**: The service account lacks permissions for `/api/v1/*` endpoints specifically.

3. **Not a 401 Issue**: We're getting 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized, which means:
   - The authentication is working (token is valid)
   - The service account identity is recognized
   - But the service account doesn't have permission to access this specific resource

### Service Account Details:
- **Email**: `nodejs-vercel-service-account@laxai-466119.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Project**: `laxai-466119` (Project Number: 517529966392)
- **Service URL**: `https://laxai-api-517529966392.us-central1.run.app`

### Next Steps Required:

1. **Check IAM Permissions**: The service account needs additional roles/permissions for the API endpoints.

2. **Possible Required Roles**:
   - `Cloud Run Invoker` role specifically for this service
   - Custom IAM policy for `/api/v1/*` endpoints
   - Resource-level permissions for the Cloud Run service

3. **Backend Configuration Check**: The Cloud Run service might have:
   - Path-based IAM conditions
   - Different authentication requirements for API vs root endpoints
   - Custom middleware that requires additional permissions

### Immediate Action:
The issue is on the **Google Cloud IAM side**, not in the frontend code. The service account needs additional permissions to access the `/api/v1/*` endpoints on the Cloud Run service.

### Code Status:
- ✅ Frontend authentication code is working correctly
- ✅ Environment variables are configured properly  
- ✅ Service account credentials are valid
- ❌ Service account lacks permissions for API endpoints
